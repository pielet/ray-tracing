# Ray Tracing

The code is mainly based on [Ray Tracing: The Next Week](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracingthenextweek).

### There are some important features:
* 3 different meterial types with adjustable parameters
* texture map for sphere and cube
* ray tracing for imported .obj model (Moller-Trumbore algorithm and Phong shading)

### Output images:
